Pommona College CS051: GitHub Course Development
========

## About

In the Fall 2015 [Introduction to Computer Science Course][1], we will begin
trialing the use of Git and GitHub in the lab workflow in an effort to optimize
the distribution-submisison-feedback cycle and expose students to an industry
standard versioning and collaborative development tool.

This repository is dedicated to preparing documents and resources for using
these tools in this Java based course that uses the Eclipse IDE. The original
proposal for the trial can be found [here][2].
