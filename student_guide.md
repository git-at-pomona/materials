## Why Git and GitHub?

The goal of implementing Git and GitHub in the CS051 lab workflow is to
optimize the distribution-submission-feedback cycle for assignments while
exposing students to industry standard tools. It will (hopefully) help students
recieve more feedback on their code and make it easier for TAs and professors
to provide that feedback.

*Git is used extensievly throughout the open source and professional
development communites, so learning about these invaluable tools will add to
the set of skills you know how to work with to become a more effective
developer. However, CS051's focus is on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and
design--not on Git; therefore, we will not be covering advanced Git topics
nor will we require you to know them. In some cases, as you will see as you
read below, we have wrapped multi-Git steps with simpler commands.*

At any point during the semester, **please ask questions** about Git and GitHub
if you have questions or concerns. If the Git-related instructions make no
sense, please let us know so we can clarify them!

## Tools You Will Be Using

### Eclipse IDE

Eclipse is an open-source **integrated development environment** (IDE) that we
will be using in CS051 to work on the Java assignments. (It's where you'll
spend the majority of your time developing your lab assignments.) An IDE is
software that bundles together all the various tools that are needed to write
code and run that code. It includes everything from source code editors to
debugging tools to compilers to console emulators.

### Git

Git is a distributed **version control system** (VCS) that has become the
industry-standard for development in open-soure and professional communities
thanks to the popularization and adoption of the online repository hosting
service [GitHub](#github).

Git aids in the development of software and projects by allowing the developer
(or team of developers) to take snapshots of their work as they progress. This
allows you to--at any point in the project--revert changes that you or a team
member has made. At the core of Git, you have a **repository** which is where
your code lives as well as a `.git` directory that contains the data that Git
uses to track your changes. Another key feature of Git is it's idea of
**branching**. 

In a git-managed project, the goal is to have a `master` branch that contains a
functional and deployable copy of your code. As you develop features, you will
`checkout` other branches that you can develop on. When the feature is in
deployable condition, you merge it back in with the `master` branch. (We'll
be explaining more about this in another section!)

### GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) is an online Git repository hosting service. It's
where you will be pulling new assignments from and pushing your submissions.

In addition to supporting many features of Git, GitHub has added extra online
features like issue tracking, inline code commenting, and Pull Requests (PR)
that we will be utilizing throughout the semester.

### EGit

EGit is an implementation of Git in the Eclipse IDE; it supports the way the
IDE sets up projects and stores the files on your computer. This plug-in also
includes a graphical user interface (GUI) to complete common Git commands
without having to use the command line (although we will be using a bit of
the command line this semester).

### Terminal

A terminal is a way to interact with a computer by giving it text commands. The
commands can include everything from making a directory (`mkdir myDirectory`)
to removing a file (`rm myFile`) to running a console application like `git`.

In Eclipse, you will be using a Terminal Emulator that will allow you to
execute basic system commands like navigating into a folder
(`cd path/to/folder`) or running Git commands and aliases we created for this
course.
