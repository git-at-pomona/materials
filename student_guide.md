## Why Git and GitHub?

The goal of implementing Git and GitHub in the CS051 lab workflow is to
optimize the distribution-submission-feedback cycle for assignments while
exposing students to industry standard tools. It will (hopefully) help students
recieve more feedback on their code and make it easier for TAs and professors
to provide that feedback.

*Git is used extensievly throughout the open source and professional
development communites, so learning about these invaluable tools will add to
the set of skills you know how to work with to become a more effective
developer. However, CS051's focus is on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and
design--not on Git; therefore, we will not be covering advanced Git topics
nor will we require you to know them. In some cases, as you will see as you
read below, we have wrapped multi-Git steps with simpler commands.*

At any point during the semester, **please ask questions** about Git and GitHub
if you have questions or concerns. If the Git-related instructions make no
sense, please let us know so we can clarify them!
